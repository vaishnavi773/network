Q:compare two files and determine if they are identical. If you'd also like to delete one of the files


#!/bin/bash

FILE1="date.sh"
FILE2="date.sh"

if cmp -s "date.sh" "date.sh"; then
    echo "The files are identical."
    echo "Deleting date.sh..."
    rm "date.sh"
else
    echo "The files are different."
fi
